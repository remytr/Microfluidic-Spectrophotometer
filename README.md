# Microfluidic-Spectrophotometer
Microfluidic Spectrophotometer project completed at Advanced Hackspace, Imperial College London.

A microfluidic spectrophotometer measusres the intensity of a light beam shone at an unkown liquid passed through it. This intensity value can then be compared with known values to determine the unknown liquid.

- Used Computer Aided Design (CAD) to produce parts and assemblies. 
- These designs were to used to 3D printed using stereolithography (SLA) and laser cutting.
- Learned the basics of electromechanical hardware, using stepper motors and servos.
- Assmebled PCBs.
